### Porject Description
I'm trying to build a particle collision simulator to learn more about computer graphics. 

Some resources that I have found helpful:
<ul>
  <li>Collision Detection: https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/collision-detection#rectangle-point-collision</li>
  <li>Processing example of collision and motion https://processing.org/examples/circlecollision.html</li>
  <li>Youtube video on the general principal and ideas behind particle collision: https://youtu.be/eED4bSkYCB8?si=4KOri9YXIRfGgl_s</li>
	<li>A document explaining 2D collison: https://www.vobarian.com/collisions/2dcollisions2.pdf<li>
</ul>
