### Porject Description
I'm trying to build a particle collision simulator to learn more about computer graphics. 
Features include:
  - Gravity 
  - Collision Damping 
  - Interaction with the particles, dragging, clicking
  - Create new particle with different size

Download the file and open the Particle_Generation.pde Then add a new tab in teh file and add the Class_ball.pde file.
